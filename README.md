# ✈️ British Airways Data Science Simulation – May 2025

This repository showcases the completion of the **British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience** on Forage. Through two hands-on projects, I applied practical **data science**, **machine learning**, and **data analysis** skills to real-world airline data.

## 🚀 Project Summary

The simulation is structured into two main tasks:

### 📊 [Task 1 – Customer Sentiment Analysis](./Task1/)
- Collected and cleaned customer reviews from an airline feedback dataset
- Performed **sentiment analysis** to gauge positive and negative customer experiences
- Created a **WordCloud** to visualize common review terms
- Extracted key insights for British Airways to improve customer satisfaction

### 🤖 [Task 2 – Predictive Modeling of Customer Bookings](./Task2/)
- Explored and preprocessed customer booking data
- Built a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict booking completions
- Achieved **85% model accuracy**
- Evaluated results using classification metrics and visualizations
- Highlighted important features influencing customer decisions

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- WordCloud
- Git & GitHub

## 📌 Outcome & Learning
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with real-world datasets
- Build models that generate business insights
- Communicate findings through code, visualizations, and summaries
